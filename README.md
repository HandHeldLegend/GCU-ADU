# GCU-ADU
A template KiCad file to create add-on flex PCBs for the GC Ultimate

## NOTES
There is a stiffener layer. The total thickness of the FPC plus the stiffener layer MUST be 0.3mm. Please ensure this matches according to whichever PCB fabrication house you use.

There is also an adhesive layer that is optional but recommended. to help secure the PCB in place.

The Switches are placeholder and you will likely need to make modifications to ensure your PCB will contain the appropriate switches.

Cutouts for the RGB LEDs are present here. Do not cover those as it will complicate the install process. Assume that any cutouts here are 100% necessary and should not be tampered with.
